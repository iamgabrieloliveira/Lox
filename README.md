Welcome to the Lox Interpreter, an implementation of the Lox programming language from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

## Purpose

This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP) project (*Written in Rust btw*) aimed at building a fully functional interpreter for the Lox programming language as described in *Crafting Interpreters*. The goal is to understand the intricacies of interpreter design and implementation.
